### Python Binding Development

This project uses `maturin` to build the Rust-based Python extension. It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment.

#### Setup

1.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install maturin pytest
    ```

#### Building

To compile the library and install it into your active virtual environment, run:

```bash
maturin develop --features python_bindings
```
